#PTCG Collector
PTCG Collector is a website for Pokemon Card collectors to track their collections and view statistics about their collections such as price, rarity, and diversity. Users will also be able to post trades and send trade offers similar to a marketplace. The goal of the project is to make it easier for people to track their collections and to overall get an understanding of what they have as well as get things theyve been wanting.

##Tech Stack
Backend: For the backend I will be using Express and Node.js while the database will be using Postgresql 

Frontend: For the frontend I will be using React with Axios for interacting with my backend.

This project will be a balanced full stack application with much backend and frontend develeopment. 

##API
This project will use the Pokemon TCG Api in order to gather data about the pokemon cards such as prince, type, picture, set and any other necessary data. 

##Database Schema
![Database Schema](/Users/zach/springboard/PTCG-Collector/PTCG-schema.png)

I will need to hash the users passwords before entering them into the database.

##Stretch Goals
* Post feature to share collection
* Create a mobile app versionb of the frontend
